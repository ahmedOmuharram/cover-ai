# Cover AI

Cover AI is a Chrome extension that helps you write better cover letters faster by generating the perfect prompt for large language models (LLMs). With just a few clicks, Cover AI scrapes the job description, pulls out the most important details, and combines them with your resume and an existing cover letter you've uploaded. The result is a highly tailored prompt that helps you quickly customize your cover letter for any jobâ€”saving you time and improving your chances of landing interviews.

## Installation Steps

- Make sure to pin the extension for easy access and auto scraping
- Any time you want a tailored prompt, simply click our extension in the corner and select your resumes/cover letters.
- The extension should automatically scrape the job description for any job on LinkedIn Jobs, however you can also manually highlight the job description, right click and click our icon to add the job description automatically.
- From there, just select generate prompt or automatic to either generate a prompt for an LLM or to automatically generate a pdf using an API key.
